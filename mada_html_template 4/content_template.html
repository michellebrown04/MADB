        <h1>What's Up with Social Media Algorithms?</h1>
        <p>
          Social media algorithms totally change how we see stuff online. They
          shape what pops up in our feeds and what we spend time looking at.

      <section id="how-they-work">
        <h2>How Do These Algorithms Even Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Social media algorithms are like super-smart bots that check out what
          we're into, what we click on, and what we share. Then, they use that
          info to show us more stuff we might like.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cool Stuff First: They show us posts and videos they think we'll be
            into, based on what we've liked before.
          </li>
          <li>
            Popular Picks: The stuff that lots of people are liking and sharing
            gets bumped up, so we're more likely to see it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Checking Us Out: They keep an eye on what we're up to, like what
            we're searching for and who we're chatting with, to guess what we
            might be interested in next.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Moment: They're always looking out for the latest hot topics
            and trends, so they can show us what's happening right now.

        <h2>How It Affects What We See</h2>
        <p>
          Social media algorithms totally change how we see stuff online. They
          shape what pops up in our feeds and what we spend time looking at.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Living in a Bubble:</strong> Social media keeps us in our
            own little bubbles, only showing us stuff it thinks we'll like. That
            means we might miss out on seeing different stuff or hearing other
            people's opinions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Missing Out:</strong> Sometimes, we don't get to see a whole
            range of different ideas or viewpoints because the algorithms keep
            showing us the same stuff over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Getting Stuck:</strong> It's easy to end up in an echo
            chamber, where we only see stuff that agrees with what we already
            think. That makes it harder to hear different perspectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not Always True:</strong> Social media can sometimes spread
            false info without us even realizing it. That's not cool!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Click, Click, Click:</strong> Sometimes, the stuff that gets
            shown to us is all about getting us to click on it, even if it's not
            that important. It's like they're trying to grab our attention!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tricked:</strong> Sometimes, people try to trick us by using
            sneaky tactics to make us believe stuff or do stuff we wouldn't
            normally do.
